# Perudo

## How to Play the Game

Perudo, also known as Liar's Dice, is a dice game of bluffing and deduction. Here are the basic rules and instructions to play:

### Objective
The goal of the game is to be the last player with dice remaining.

### Setup
1. Each player starts with an equal number of dice (typically 5).
2. Players roll their dice secretly and keep their results hidden from others.

### Gameplay
1. **Starting the Round**:
   - The first player makes a bid about the total number of dice showing a specific face value (e.g., "There are at least three 4s").
   - The bid includes both the quantity and the face value.

2. **Next Player's Turn**:
   - The next player can either:
     - **Raise the Bid**: Increase the quantity or face value of the bid.
     - **Call the Bluff**: Challenge the previous player's bid by saying "Dudo" (Spanish for "I doubt").

3. **Resolving a Bluff**:
   - If a bluff is called, all players reveal their dice.
   - Count the total number of dice showing the face value in the bid.
   - If the bid is correct (equal to or greater than the actual count), the challenger loses a die.
   - If the bid is incorrect, the bidder loses a die.

4. **Continuing the Game**:
   - The next round begins with the player who lost a die making the first bid.
   - Players who lose all their dice are eliminated from the game.

### Special Rules
- **Ones (Wilds)**: The face value of 1 is typically considered wild and can count as any number.
- **Exact Call**: Some variations allow players to call "Exact" if they believe the bid is exactly correct. If correct, they gain a die back; if incorrect, they lose a die.

### Winning the Game
The last player with dice remaining is the winner.
